- You can also directly commit changes on GitHub itself; just make sure that the code files are running, preprocessed, and giving accuracy, otherwise they won't be merged.

## Add Your Machine Learning Project

- Choose any dataset from the datasets folder.
- Create a new file in the models folder.
- Inside the 'models' folder, add a Jupyter notebook with your machine learning model.
- Ensure that the model achieves an accuracy of at least 55 percent.
- Include a README in the folder with instructions on how to use the model and information about its accuracy.
- Make a pull request to add your project to the models folder.
